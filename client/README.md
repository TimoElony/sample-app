# React Frontend for a Route Database

## Checklist/ reminders

[] do a first component really quick to not get shy and stuck, then reevaluate
[] create static version of App, no state
[] add state sparingly
[] useEffect to sync with server, not for every render

## ideas

- 10% a functional database interface
- 150% a typical red granite rock closeup, on scroll reveals outlines of Sinai, camera tilts away to look at the outline with blue water background roughly the angle of the sun at noon and 6 columns rise, each height representing the amount of climbing routes
